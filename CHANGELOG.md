## [Unreleased]

- `/adopt-standard` shakedown fixes from its first real adoption
  (EasyCaller/Caller-development, 10 defects): the "what this command
  writes" summary no longer contradicts step 6's hook-wiring body; step 2
  now documents a non-interactive (`AskUserQuestion`-unavailable) fallback
  that infers/defaults conservatively and records every assumption
  prominently instead of guessing silently; step 1's prod/dev checkout
  heuristic now resolves ROLE from directory-name convention and
  repo-wide branch existence, not from either checkout's current (often
  mid-work, non-stable) HEAD; step 2's checklist now covers
  `worktrees.root`/`worktrees.namePattern` explicitly, including their
  linked-worktree-aware default resolution; `repo.standingLoopBranch`'s
  ask no longer conflates the branch name with whether the loop pack is
  active (`loops.enabled` controls that); `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` resolution
  for an agent invoking the scripts directly (outside a plugin-loaded
  session) is now documented; step 7 now distinguishes a red gate caused
  by this command's own scaffolding from a red gate surfacing genuine
  pre-existing docs debt (report the latter, never silently fix it); and a
  new "Adopting a project with existing docs" section captures the
  real-world lessons.
- `docs/standard-architecture.md`'s canonical `maple.config.json` example
  (models EasyCaller) corrected to match its real layout —
  `prodBranch: "production"` (was the stale `"main"`; EasyCaller has no
  `main` branch) and `lint.roots` reflecting the real `app/src`/`admin/src`/
  `frontend/app` roots (was a generic `src`/`frontend/src` that doesn't
  exist in that project) — plus its step-6 wording aligned with the
  adopt-standard fix above (no per-project hook merge; collision-flagging
  only).
- Fixed `plugin/scripts/docs/lib/preamble.mjs`'s legacy blockquote-preamble
  parser hardcoding bold markdown (`**Audience:**`) as the only recognized
  label form — a real adopting project's identical-structure, non-bold
  preamble (`> Audience: ...`) was silently unrecognized, producing false
  "no anchor" drift-gate warnings. Both forms parse identically now, and a
  legacy page with only `Audience:`/`Authoritative for:` (no `Code:`/
  `Enforced by:`/etc.) correctly counts as anchored, matching the
  frontmatter path's own parity. New standalone tests in
  `plugin/scripts/docs/lib/preamble.test.mjs`.
- Bundled the canonical docs tooling into the plugin (`plugin/scripts/docs/`
  — `check-docs-drift.mjs`, `generate-docs-index.mjs`, `next-task-id.mjs`,
  `doc-search/search.mjs`), config-driven via `maple.config.json` `docs.*`
  so non-template adopters get them without owning copies (#T13). This
  template's own `scripts/*.mjs` are now thin delegates to the bundled
  versions — `package.json` scripts, husky hooks, and CI tiers are
  unaffected.
- Docs system aligned with Google OKF v0.1 (D010): pages carry YAML
  frontmatter (`type`/`title`/`description`/`tags`/`timestamp` +
  `audience`/`authoritative_for`/`code`/`reference_for`); the legacy prose
  blockquote preamble still works but the drift gate now warns on it.
  `docs/index.md`'s Catalog section is generated from each page's
  frontmatter `description` between `<!-- catalog:begin/end -->` markers;
  the gate errors if it goes stale. Both `[[wikilinks]]` and relative
  markdown links to in-docs `.md` files are now validated (external
  http(s) links ignored). All 10 of this template's own `docs/*.md` pages
  migrated to frontmatter as the reference implementation.
- Instantiated from the maple-standard template.
